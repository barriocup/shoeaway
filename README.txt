ShoeAway - Multi-page demo (localStorage DB)

Files included:
- index.html
- shop.html
- cart.html
- orders.html
- login.html
- register.html
- styles.css
- app.js

Instructions:
1. Unzip and upload the files to a GitHub repository. Enable GitHub Pages (if desired) to serve the static site.
2. The app uses browser localStorage for users, cart, and orders. No server required.
3. Register a user via register.html, then login and shop.

Notes:
- localStorage is per browser. Use same browser to persist data.
- This is a demo for school projects. Do not use localStorage for real production authentication.
